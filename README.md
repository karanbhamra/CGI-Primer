# CGI-Primer
A project that combines Perl and CGI.

Use it by navigating to the cgi-bin directory and running it on the Apache server.

Usage: 

- First way, pass a value to a variable in query string: http://www.csun.edu/~ksb46159/cgi-bin/simple.cgi?url=www.csun.edu

- Second way, enter the url in the form provided on the webpage and press submit: http://www.csun.edu/~ksb46159/cgi-bin/simple.cgi

Log:

- Looked up what CGI-BIN was, and how it worked.

- Had a test cgi program print out "test".

- Got a simple Perl cgi program to display output of curl.

- Displayed a custom html page.

- Added ability to use query string to display url of user's choice.

- Figured out how to split the query string. 

- Figured out how to follow redirects with curl through program arguments.

- Added a redirect to index.html to take users to the cgi-bin folder and script automatically.

- Figured out how to remove encoding from url and get raw url so certain websites work correctly. (This was just a bonus)

- Added styling to the html so the users page starts below the script and does not affect the styling.

- Finished project.

Summary:

- Met the requirements, and is completed and runs.
